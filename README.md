# Line-Following-Car

### Parts:
- Arduino Mega (powered by power bank)
- SmartElex 15D Motor Driver
- 12V 7Ah Battery
- 4 geared motors
- RGBY LEDs (optional)
- IR Sensors x 2
The IR Sensors I used in the circuit diagrams arent the ones used in the project. I used them since the connections are pretty much the same.
They look like this:
